			<p>Bees pollinate crops such as apples, cranberries, melons, almonds, and broccoli. Fruits like blueberries and cherries are 90% dependent on 
			honey bee pollination, and during bloom time, almonds depend entirely on honey bees for pollination. The fruits and vegetables you eat on a daily basis are also 
			made possibly by honey bee pollination, including but not limited to watermelons, pumpkins, squashes, zucchinis, lentils, tomatoes, strawberries, mangos, avocados, 
			plums, peaches, apricots, pomegranates, pears, blackberries, raspberries, grapes, peanuts,
			macadamia nuts, mustard seeds, coconuts, soybeans, and coffee. There are also other kinds of bees all important for the pollination of our 
			food supply and more.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Help produce 1/3 of our food supply.</li>
				<li>Help provide ½ of the world's fibers, oils, and other raw materials.</li>
				<li>Help create many medicines.</li>
				<li>Provide food for wildlife.</li>
				<li>Help prevent soil erosion.</li>

			<h1>Bee Colonies</h1>
			<image src="images/beehive.jpg" class="round">
			<p>A honey bee hive has one colony, which typically consists of 20,000 bees. 
			The number of colonies for pollination a fruit or vegetable requires varies:<p>
			<ul class="tablet-desktop">
				<li>Almonds: 2 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Cranberries: 2-3 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Blueberries: 1-2 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Watermelons: 1.3 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Apples: 1-2 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Cucumbers: 3 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Squashes: 1-2 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Pumpkins: 0.5-1 colony/acre</li>
				<li>Pears: 1-2 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Peaches: 1-3 colonies/acre</li>
				<li>Cherries: 1-2 colonies/acre</li>

						<h3>Bee Dangers And How To Protect From That Threat </h3>
						<p>Deforestation: Bees that lose their hive face difficulties, ranging from finding their way home to welcoming them into a new colony. &amp; Recycle and plant your own trees because bees prefer to build hives on trees.</p>
						<p>Neonicotinoid Pesticides: Harm the bees ability to groom, navigate, and contaminates the pollen in the rest of the beehive &amp; Buy organic from places that don't support the use of neonic pesticides, read labels, and maybe grow your own food.</p>
						<p>Climate Change: Flowers lose their regular scents from lack of water and heat stress and release defensive compounds instead that the bees would usually track;
						and also cause their to be less flowers blooming and available to pollinate when the bees come out of winter hibernation. &amp; Protect and manage bee-friendly habitats like coastal areas, grasslands, brownfield sites, farmlands, saltmarshes, and sea walls among others.</p>
						<p>Diseases: Disease causes many bees to have mites, deformed wings, and kills millions of bees around the world. &amp; Commercial honeybees and commercial bumblebees should be screened regularly for parasites and other diseases to protect our wild bees</p>
						<p>Pests: The wax moth, varroa mite, and the tracheal mite feed off the hive's beeswax, larvae, or infect their respiratory systems. &amp; The way to treat varies, but one way for beekeepers to treat at least the tracheal mites is to use menthol, such as methanol crystal packets in the hive during the fall, and vegetable shortening sugar patties placed in the fall and/or spring can also help with mite control by disrupting their life cycle.</p>
